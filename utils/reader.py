    This function constructs features according to the rules specified in Gamberger and Lavrac (2002).
    Each feature is an indicator function that establishes constraints on the values
    of individuals in the dataset. Features are constructed in the following way:
    
    * For discrete attributes, features are A_i=v_ip and A_i!=v_in. The values v_ip and v_in como
    from the domain of attribute A_i considering only positive and negative samples respectively.
    
    * For continuous attributes, features are:
        1 - A_i <= (v_ip+v_in)/2, for each pair of consecutive values v_ip and v_in (in this order), 
        conditioned that v_ip comes from the domain of A_i in positive samples and v_in 
        from the domain of A_i in negative samples.
        
        2 - A_i > (v_in+v_ip)/2, for each pair of consecutive values v_in and v_ip (in this order),
        and v_in and v_ip are values from domain of A_i as described above.
    
    * For integer attributes, features are generated considering the rules for discrete and continuous
    attributes.
